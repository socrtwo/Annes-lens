# File formats (plan)

Anne's Lens will open pictures from every current and historical program it can read faithfully, recognizing each file by its **content, not its extension**, the same way the other Anne's Office apps do. A misnamed file, or one with no extension, opens with the right reader, and a short note says when the content and the name disagree (*File ▸ Rename* offers the right extension).

Decoders come from three places, chosen per platform at run time:
1. **The platform's own codecs** where they are complete and fast (HEIC/HEIF and AVIF on recent Android, iOS and macOS; WIC on Windows for formats with installed codecs).
2. **The app's own readers and writers**, TypeScript or WebAssembly built from permissively licensed libraries, so every platform (including the web build) opens the same set.
3. **Optional format modules**, downloaded on request, for codecs whose size or license keeps them out of the base app. Each shows its license before download.

Fidelity tiers:
- **Full**: pixels, bit depth, transparency, color profile, metadata, pages/frames/layers as composite.
- **High**: pixels and metadata; some format features shown approximately (for example a rare compression mode decoded to 8 bits per channel).
- **Preview**: the embedded preview or a single composite, with metadata (used for formats whose full data is undocumented).
- **Identify**: the format is recognized and described, its metadata shown, and the reason it cannot be opened is explained.

## Camera RAW

| Family | Extensions | Open |
|---|---|---|
| DNG | .dng | Full (develop, own code: Bayer and linear data, uncompressed, packed or lossless JPEG) and embedded preview; a DNG without a usable preview develops on open |
| Canon, Nikon, Sony, Fujifilm, Olympus/OM, Panasonic, Pentax, Leica, Hasselblad, Phase One, Sigma, Samsung, others | .cr2 .cr3 .crw .nef .nrw .arw .srf .sr2 .raf .orf .rw2 .pef .rwl .3fr .iiq .x3f .srw … | **Preview** (embedded JPEG) in the base app; **develop** through the optional RAW module |

The base app reads every RAW file's TIFF-like structure and metadata and shows the embedded preview instantly, which is what culling needs. Full development (demosaicing, camera color matrices, highlight recovery) is an optional module because the mature open decoders are LGPL/CDDL-licensed; the module is a separate download, dynamically loaded, with its license shown (see [LEGAL.md](LEGAL.md)).

## Historical formats

Files with no magic number (Atari ST, Commodore 64) are recognized by their extension, exact size and header values. Extensions shared with other kinds of file (.img disk images, .dd dumps, .int, .rs) are left out of folder listings and file associations, so those files are not read as pictures while browsing; a file with such a name that is opened, dropped or named on the desktop command line (up to 16 MB) is recognized by content.

| Format | Program(s) | Era | Extensions | Planned tier |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| MacPaint | MacPaint | 1984– | .mac .pntg .pnt | **Done:** Full (576 × 720, 1 bit; plain or in a MacBinary file) |

Still to do: color pixel patterns (their 1-bit pattern is used), other QuickTime codecs, PostScript-only pictures |
| IFF ILBM / PBM (Amiga, Deluxe Paint) | Deluxe Paint | 1985– | .iff .ilbm .lbm .ham | **Done:** Full (1–8 bitplanes, Extra Half-Brite, HAM6/HAM8, 24/32-bit deep ILBM, chunky PBM, ByteRun1, mask planes and transparent colors, 4-bit OCS palettes widened, CRNG/CCRT color cycling played as an animation) |

Checked against GIMP's PSP reader on files written from the format description (1-bit pictures against the written picture only: GIMP reads them differently). Still to do, with no independent reader to check against (GIMP does not apply PSP layer masks and ignores the saved composite): layer masks, the saved composite for vector and adjustment layers, PSP X's newer blocks |
| CorelDRAW / Corel PHOTO-PAINT | Corel | 1990s– | .cdr .cpt | Recognized by content (RIFF `CDR`/`cdr`, `CPT<n>FILE`), not opened: no file was available to build a reader from. Opening one offers **Help ▸ Send a Sample File**, which emails the file to the developer from the user's own mail program after the terms are agreed to (see LEGAL.md). Planned once samples arrive: Preview (embedded) |
| Microsoft Paint (Windows 1–3) | Paintbrush | 1985–92 | .msp | **Done:** Full (versions 1 and 2) |

JBIG2 files (sequential or random-access, every page, shared dictionaries) through pdf.js's JBIG2 decoder (PDFium's, WebAssembly) |
| Wavelet and fractal oddities | various | 1990s | .wi .fif | Identify |

Formats that are proprietary and undocumented are attempted only clean-room from public information; where that is not enough, Anne's Lens identifies the file, shows any embedded preview, and explains why it cannot open the rest.

## Files from other kinds of programs

Anne's Lens recognizes documents, spreadsheets, presentations, PDFs and e-mail by content too. It offers to open them in the matching Anne's Office app when installed, or to **Extract Embedded Pictures** (`create.extractEmbedded`) from them: pictures inside .docx, .pptx, .xlsx, .odt, .odp, .epub, .pdf, .eml and .mbox files are listed as a virtual folder, opened and saved at their original quality.

## Saving

Every writable format has an options dialog (quality, chroma subsampling, progressive, compression method, bit depth, palette and dithering, transparency, color profile, which metadata to keep). **Save for Web** and **Save to Target File Size** sit on top of the same writers. When the destination format cannot hold something the picture has (alpha in JPEG, 16-bit in GIF, layers anywhere), the save dialog says what will be lost before writing.

## Licensing notes

- **HEIC/HEIF** uses HEVC, which is covered by patent pools in many countries. Anne's Lens decodes HEIC through the operating system where the system provides it (the platform vendor has the license) and offers a separate decoder module elsewhere with a notice. It does not encode HEIC itself; *Save As* offers AVIF, JPEG XL or JPEG instead.
- **RAR** decompression is the app's own code; it contains no RARLAB (unRAR) code, whose license forbids using it to re-create RAR compression and is not an open-source license. Anne's Lens does not create RAR archives.
- **Ghostscript** (AGPL) is not used; EPS and PostScript open by their embedded previews.
